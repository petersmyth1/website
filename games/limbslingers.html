	  <h2>Limb Slingers</h2>
	  <p>
		I made Limb Slingers with my good pal <a target="_top" href="http://thnewlands.com/">Thomas Newlands</a> for Ludum Dare 33.<br>
		<br>
		Play as a scattered group of limbs who've lost their body. Try out cool new bodies in the park by sticking the bodiless ends of your limbs to anything that moves (even things that don't!)<br>
		<br>
		Use WASD or arrow keys to fling your limbs!<br>
		Press up and down flex your limbs and left and right to steer them.<br>
		Press Q and E to switch which limb you're controlling.<br>
		Pressing spacebar will detach your limb from whatever it sticks onto.<br>
		<br>
		You can take a gander at the source over at this <a target="_top" href="https://github.com/thnewlands/Ludum-Dare-33---Arms-and-Legs">github repo</a>.<br>
